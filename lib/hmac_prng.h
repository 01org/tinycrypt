 *  hmac_prng.h -- Interface to an HMAC-PRNG implementation.
 *
 *  Overview:   A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) generates a sequence
 *  		        of numbers that have a distribution close to the one expected
 *  		        for a sequence of truly random numbers. The NIST Special
 *  		        Publication 800-90A specifies several mechanisms to generate
 *  		        sequences of pseudo random numbers, including the HMAC-PRNG one
 *  		        which is based on HMAC. TinyCrypt implements HMAC-PRNG with
 *  		        certain modifications from the NIST SP 800-90A spec.
 *
 *  Security:   A cryptographically secure PRNG depends on the existence of an
 *  		        entropy source to provide a truly random seed as well as the
 *  		        security of the primitives used as the building blocks (HMAC and
 *  		        SHA256, for TinyCrypt).
 *
 *              The NIST SP 800-90A standard tolerates a null personalization,
 *              while TinyCrypt requires a non-null personalization. This is
 *              because a personalization string (the host name concatenated
 *              with a time stamp, for example) is easily computed and might be
 *              the last line of defense against failure of the entropy source.
 *
 *  Requires:   - SHA-256
 *              - HMAC
 *
 *  Usage:      1) call hmac_prng_init to set the HMAC key and process the
 *              personalization data.
 *
 *              2) call hmac_prng_reseed to process the seed and additional
 *              input.
 *
 *              3) call hmac_prng_generate to out put the pseudo-random data.

 *              entropy source.
 *
 *  Effects:    Initializes prng with personalization, disables
 *              hmac_prng_generate, and returns 1.

 *              initialization: entropy seed, personalization, and an optional
 *              nonce. TinyCrypts requires instead a non-null personalization
 *              (which is easily computed) and indirectly requires an entropy
 *              seed (since the reseed function is mandatorily called after
