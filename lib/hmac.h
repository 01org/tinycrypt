 *  hmac.h -- Interface to an HMAC implementation.
 *
 *  Overview:   HMAC is a message authentication code based on hash functions.
 *              TinyCrypt hard codes SHA-256 as the hash function. A message
 *              authentication code based on hash functions is also called a
 *              keyed cryptographic hash function since it performs a
 *              transformation specified by a key in an arbitrary length data
 *              set into a fixed length data set (also called tag).
 *
 *  Security:   The security of the HMAC depends on the length of the key and
 *              on the security of the hash function. Note that HMAC primitives
 *              are much less affected by collision attacks than their
 *              corresponding hash functions.
 *
 *  Requires:   SHA-256
 *
 *  Usage:      1) call hmac_set_key to set the HMAC key.
 *
 *              2) call hmac_init to initialize a struct hash_state before
 *              processing the data.
 *
 *              3) call hmac_update to process the next input segment;
 *              hmac_update can be called as many times as needed to process
 *              all of the segments of the input; the order is important.
 *
 *              4) call hmac_final to out put the tag.
