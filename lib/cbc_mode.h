 *  cbc_mode.h -- Interface to a CBC mode implementation.
 *
 *  Overview: CBC (for "cipher block chaining") mode is a NIST approved mode of
 *            operation defined in SP 800-38a. It can be used with any block
 *            cipher to provide confidentiality of strings whose lengths are
 *            multiples of the block_size of the underlying block cipher.
 *            TinyCrypt hard codes AES as the block cipher.
 *
 *  Security: CBC mode provides data confidentiality given that the maximum
 *            number q of blocks encrypted under a single key satisfies
 *            q < 2^63, which is not a practical constraint (it is considered a
 *            good practice to replace the encryption when q == 2^56). CBC mode
 *            provides NO data integrity.
 *
 *            CBC mode assumes that the IV value input into the cbc_mode_encrypt
 *            is randomly generated. The TinyCrypt library provides HMAC-PRNG
 *            module, which generates suitable IVs. Other methods for generating
 *            IVs are acceptable, provided that the values of the IVs generated
 *            appear random to any adversary, including someone with complete
 *            knowledge of the system design.
 *
 *            The randomness property on which CBC mode's security depends is
 *            the unpredictability of the IV. Since it is unpredictable, this
 *            means in practice that CBC mode requires that the IV is stored
 *            somehow with the ciphertext in order to recover the plaintext.
 *
 *            TinyCrypt CBC encryption prepends the IV to the ciphertext,
 *            because this affords a more efficient (few buffers) decryption.
 *            Hence cbc_mode_encrypt assumes the ciphertext buffer is always
 *            16 bytes larger than the plaintext buffer.
 *
 *  Requires: AES-128
 *
 *  Usage:    1) call cbc_mode_encrypt to encrypt data.
 *
 *            2) call cbc_mode_decrypt to decrypt data.

 *              - iv contains a 16 byte random string;
 *              - out buffer is large enough to hold the ciphertext + iv;

 *
 *  Effects:    CBC encrypts inlen bytes of the in buffer into the out buffer
 *              using the encryption key schedule provided, prepends iv
 *              to out, and returns 1.
